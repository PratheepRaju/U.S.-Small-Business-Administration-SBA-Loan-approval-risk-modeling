# U.S.-Small-Business-Administration-SBA-Loan-approval-risk-modeling

This notebook will be used to share my analysis as to whether an SBA loan should be approved or denied based on the provided SBA loan data which has certain characteristics like the industry of the business, the size of the loan, amount of the loan that is guaranteed, etc ( few to mention among the 27 features).

I have used Logistic Regression and XGBoost algorithms to get the desired models.
